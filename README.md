  Gatsby-test

## Description

This test project involves creating a flexible and accessible grid of product cards that links to a product details page. The project requires the use of Gatsby.js, GraphQL, and a tool like JSON Server or MirageJS to extract and simulate product data. The page should follow usability and performance best practices, including responsive design practices, proper use of HTML tags and attributes, and minimization of external dependencies. In this project, I used various libraries and tools during development to ensure that the application was developed with production quality code and style.

## Installation

1.First of all, you need to install this project on your computer using the following command in your console: <br/><br/>
<code>git clone https://github.com/skifton/gatsby-test.git</code>

2.The next step in order to successfully install the application, you need to open the projects folder in your console and write the following command:<br/><br/>
<code>npm install</code>

3.Now that all the dependencies are installed, it remains only to run the applications, for this you first need to run mock API. Open *api* folder in your console and run this command: <br/><br/>
<code>json-graphql-server products.json</code>

4.To perform the last step, you need to return to the root folder of the project and run the following command: <br/><br/>
<code>gatsby develop</code>

That's all! The project has been successfully installed and launched, now you can go to the local server in your browser and enjoy using this project.
